# Graduation project 2019

Main idea for the class schedule:

The first priority is the professor’s free times and TA’s free times for each subject, we take a maximum of 10 free times from each
Professor and TA, these times are from 1-25 which are 5 days per week X 5 lectures per day (from sunday to thursday in Egypt), and then we took into consideration that no conflict happens, that means no student can have 2 lectures or tutorials at the same time, no Professor
or TA can have 2 lectures or tutorials at the same time.

We assumed maximum of 3 rooms available in our credit hours department and maximum of 70 students in each session. The database used has a
syntax (order) about how these data should be sorted, this syntax along with Instructions for using the program are provided for users to use in any semester or for other departments or colleges. The user could enter the path for the database they want to use, and if not entered, it is assumed to be located in ”C:\Table\table.xls”.
There is a field called “summer“ if the user wants to double the lectures and tutorials using the same database by entering 1 in this field, also there is an instruction file for the users in case of difficulties.


Main idea for the final exams table:

Next we have the finals exams table, we took into consideration that no conflicts happen of course and in our credit hours department we
have exams 3 days per week (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday) the user can enter the desired date to start exams and if not entered, it is
assumed to start 1/1/2020 . If there will be any holidays after the start day of exams (vacations on Sunday, Tuesday or Thursday)
the user could enter its date, we assumed maximum of 3 exceptions, in which case the program skips these days in the schedule and
updates the dates of exams accordingly.
The dates are accurate even if the exams start and continue in different years (for example starting in December and ending in January).
